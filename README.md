# Book Recommendation App

Welcome to the Book Recommendation App! This app uses collaborative filtering to recommend books based on user ratings.

## Introduction

This project is aimed at providing book recommendations to users based on their preferences and ratings. It utilizes a collaborative filtering approach to analyze user ratings and suggest books that are similar to the ones they have liked before.

## How it Works

The app consists of two main components:

1. **Backend (Flask):**
   - Python Flask framework is used to create the backend server.
   - A machine learning model is trained to recommend books based on user ratings.
   - The server exposes an endpoint to receive book names and return recommendations.

2. **Frontend:**
   - The frontend can be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface.
   - It communicates with the backend server to fetch and display book recommendations.
## Usage

1. Ensure that you have the following files in the project directory:
   - `app.py`: Flask application script.
   - `templates/index.html`: HTML file for the frontend interface.
   - `BX-Books.csv`: Dataset containing book information.
   - `BX-Book-Ratings.csv`: Dataset containing book ratings.
   
   Note: You need to create the `BX-Books.csv` and `BX-Book-Ratings.csv` files or download them from an appropriate source.

2. **Important**: Before running the Flask application, make sure to add the `index.html` file to the `templates` folder in the project directory. This file is required for the frontend interface of the application.

3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
